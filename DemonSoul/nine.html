ANYTHING is an unconventional romance about Earl, a middle-aged widower who moves to Los Angeles to be with family, and who asserts his independence by renting an apartment in a sketchy neighborhood full of "colorful" characters. Most colorful of all is Frida, a transgender next door neighbor who happens to find Earl-the quintessential Southern Gentleman-just as exotic as he finds her. Forming a relationship that is at once unexpected and inevitable, this mismatched pair give each other much-needed trust, respect... and more.
